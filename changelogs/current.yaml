new_features:
- area: config
  change: |
    Added the capability to defer broadcasting of certain cluster (CDS, EDS) to worker threads from the main thread. This optimization can save significant amount of memory in cases where there are (1) a large number of workers and (2) a large amount of config, most of which is unused. This capability is guarded by :ref:`enable_deferred_cluster_creation <envoy_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.ClusterManager.enable_deferred_cluster_creation>`.
- area: extension_discovery_service
  change: |
    added ECDS support for :ref:` downstream network filters<envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Filter.config_discovery>`.
